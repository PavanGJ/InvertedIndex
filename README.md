# Information Retrieval: Boolean Query and Inverted Index

<i> This project was carried out as part of CSE 435/535 at University at Buffalo, State University of New York during Fall 2016</i>

This project deals with query processing over RCV2 multilingual news corpus. This project can be split into two tasks:
* Inverted Index generation
* Boolean Query Processing

The Inverted Index is built on the backbone of a LinkedList and populated using the information extracted from a <em>Lucene</em> index generated from RCV2 corpus.

The specifications for the project is mentioned in [IR_Project2.pdf](IR_Project2.pdf)
